# Oli-notes

This personal project is a tool to help me refresh my memory on notes that i have taken while reading. It uses a custom API to retrieve a randomly selected note from a collection of notes . I built this as I need a way review and reinforcing key points from a texts, as well as for simply reminding of ideas and information I may have forgotten.
