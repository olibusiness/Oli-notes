This project is a Pomodoro timer, a time management tool that helps users stay focused and productive by breaking their work into intervals separated by short breaks.
I created this project as I wanted a timer that would allow me to easily set custom work and break duration times and provides auditory alerts when a work interval or break is complete.
The website is also set to be able to add other productivity techniques in the future.
